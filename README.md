Watt is an iOS mobile app developed for the TP-Link's Smart Plugs and Smart Lamps, that allows you to set cost for each kilowatt(kWh) and by doing this you have control of the cost in each device. Also, add support for voice actions using the "Hey Siri".

With this page of GitHub, I hope to develop a small community to report problems with the application and think of solutions.

*1 Due to hardware or firmware the HS200 v1 and HS220 v2 the night mode does not work. It's working well for HS200 v2 and v3 and HS220 v1 and v3 and all the other devices.
If you are using the HS210 KIT and you can only activate Night Mode on one of the devices, check this solution from the user <a href="https://github.com/tnmendes/watt/issues/31#issuecomment-1050225800"> @elitepuckster: Solution for the HS210 KIT</a>

# Roadmap App

- [x] Show cumulative energy usage from all devices.
- [x] Show energy consumption by last 30 days, month.
- [x] Show daily cost metrics
- [x] Make it work with HS100
- [x] Night Mode (Option to turn off the led light).
- [x] Show more info about each device (Like real-time consumption, Voltage, wireless signal)
- [x] The ability to reset the stats for when a different appliance/device is plugged in and I want to start fresh.
- [x] Create a concept "Room/Spaces" which will aggregate multiple devices.
- [x] Find a way to give commands to Siri to turn on/off device (maybe using Siri shortcut)
- [x] Add support to TP-Link HS300, KP303, KL50, KP200, KP400, HS107, KP100.
- [x] Add support to Smart Bulb KL50, KL50B, KL60, LB200, LB230(E26), LB230.
- [x] Implement Haptic Touch.
- [x] Add support to all Tapo devices.
- [x] Calculate the energy cost for smart switches (HS200, HS210 and HS220) based on Runtime + default/set value consumed energy.
- [x] Show chart gathering all devices and the total cost.
- [x] Support for the MacOS version (MacOS 10.15 or higher version)
- [x] Customization for device icons
- [x] Safe toggle, option to protect your devices from accidentally turning on/off
- [ ] Export the data to Excel (CSV)	
- [ ] Force reboot, turn Off device then On after 30 seconds turn on again (Helpful for devices like wifi routers connected to the smart plug)
- [ ] Set Goals to save energy
- [ ] Make a personalized schedule that  will tell you how much money you will save by turning off your device x hours
- [ ] Add Party Mode using the Smart Bulbs (change color and brightness)
- [ ] Add new command to Siri so we can select Color Temperature from Bulb
- [ ] When you are on a Bulb information screen, add shortcuts for common colors and temperatures.

# Roadmap Server/Web
(The server still hasn't started the implementation much because of my lack of time, and lack of knowledge of server side-development)

- [ ] Send a weekly email with consumption reports and charts.
- [ ] Record the energy consumption hour by hour
- [ ] Show energy consumption by day, bill.
- [ ] The option to define peak and off-peak times and electricity prices.
- [ ] Make smart action (like if consumption is lower then specific value turn off(stand-by), or using GPS and when arriving home turn on the light, even use the weather forecast to make action, define amount time before sunset/sunrise action)
- [ ] Add Artificial Intelligence (IA) to detect and send you push notification when some consumption is not right like: leave the refrigerator door open, washer is done.
- [ ] If you have multiple devices connected to single HS110 use artificial intelligence to detect which devices are turned on and off and how much each one of them is spending.
- [ ] Monitor the voltage and if it is out of normal values send a warning or/and turn off the device
- [ ] Make web version




# FAQ

1 - What is "Night Mode" functionality?
> On all TP-Link plugs and switches there is a light to inform you that the device is active. The problem is that when the device is placed in the room it is annoying to have that LED active. With this feature, you can turn off that LED.

2 - How to activate the "Night Mode"?
> To activate "Night Mode" you will have to follow these steps: Click on the button on the bottom right "â–²". Click in one of the circles that will open a screen with information about your device. On that screen, you have a button on the top left for configuration, click on it. Now just go down and you'll find "Night Mode".

3 - Do all devices support "Night Mode"?
> Almost all Kasa Smart devices are supporting, except: "HS200 v1", "HS220 v2" and the HS210 KIT(just the slave) I believe that is because of hardware limitations.

4 - Where is the Android App?
> This app does not exist on Android and there are no plans for development. I'm just iOS Developer and I don't have knowledge of Android. 

5 - There's a huge spelling mistake!
> I'm not native english speaker! While this may sound like a bad excuse, it's legit. I'm doing my best to write understandable english, but I sometimes fail to notice an error. So again, if you happen to find a grammar or spelling mistake, just drop me a note and I'll correct!
